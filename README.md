RIPV2: This project implements a RIP (Routing Information Protocol) router in Python. The router can manage routing tables and communicate with other routers using RIP packets according to the protocol specifications.

Additionally, the project uses UDP sockets for communication through configured network interfaces and implements threading to handle received packets and manage timers for updating and removing routes.
